# Dolphinator
Arduino based ultrasonic distance sensor with vibration feedback for educatory puropse.
I built this to give students the experience of an extra sense - a sense for distance. This makes understanding echolocation very intuitive and also, it's a lot of fun! The complete costs are around 35 bucks a piece (excluding the bike helmet) plus some time for wiring and crafting.

## Parts list
- Arduino: Uno Rev.3
- Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04
- Vibration motor: Grove - Vibration motor
- Grove cable
- 3-wire extension cable from Arduino to HC-SR04
- Red LEDs
- Standard Powerbank
- Bike helmet
- Cardboard box

## Description
This is just a very simple proof of concept. I recommend to get any generic vibration motor - the grove motor uses special cables that either go into your arduino through a grove base shield or you cut them and connect them to standard jumper cables as I did. 

The LEDs are there to actually increase the power consumption (otherwise the powerbank will turn off if the vibration motor is not constantly running). They can be mounted on the helmet or wherever to make the whole thing look more cyborgy :)
